# 🎶 Pattern Detection and Polymeter Analysis of any MIDI dataset

This repository contains a easy-to-use notebook to permit you to **analyze any MIDI files dataset**, providing some patterns and informations about the time-signature structure of the given pieces of music.

## 🔍 What This Project Does

- Detects repetitive patterns occurring at regular temporal intervals in a MIDI dataset using an original morphological approch
- Analyze them and provides some informations about the evolution of the time signatures of given pieces of music
- Provide visualization tools to observe those structures
