# 🎶 Pattern Detection and Polymetric Analysis of your OWN dataset

This repository contains a easy-to-use notebook to permit you to **analyze any MIDI files dataset**, giving the patterns and the time-signature structure of the given pieces of music.

---

## 🔍 What This Project Does

- Detects repetitive patterns in a MIDI dataset using an original morphological approch
- Analyze them and interpretate the evolution of the time signatures evolution of given pieces of music
- Provide visualization tools to observe those structures and make the musicologic interpretation easier
